## Application Outputs

If you ad end of your code bunch ` >> logs.txt`, it will be appended end of the line of the file `logs.txt` in shell.

But `stderr` is different. Please read: [In the shell, what does “ 2>&1 ” mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/818255/in-the-shell-what-does-21-mean) on **stackoverflow**.

### Files List

[py_files_list.txt](py_files_list.txt) has file names (if there were in the same path), or file path (if there were in a dictionary)

### Run app.py

For `python3`:

to run,  `python app.py` 

### Logs

Logs will be saved on [logs](logs) dictionary.


**Note that**: before running `cat` command, outputs will be in `buffer` not `log file`
